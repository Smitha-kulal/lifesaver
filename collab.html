				<h3 class="mt-2">1. Seeing the Potential</h3>
				<p>
					After gathering your room measurements and identifying what you’d like to achieve, the Resource
					journey starts with a call or visit to a showroom. There you’ll connect with your personal design
					and production team who will guide you through every aspect of your project (appointments not
					required, but highly encouraged). We’ll first get to know you and your aspirations, so we can
					pinpoint the perfect solutions that beautifully, elegantly fit your exact needs.
				</p>

				<h3 class="mt-4">2. Personalized Solutions</h3>
				<p>
					Most of our furnishings are custom and made-to-order. To ensure the best solutions for your project,
					we’ll take a close look at your floor plans, measurements, photos, and other unique spatial
					considerations. For immediate furnishing needs in the US, we have an array of quick ship items ready
					for delivery, usually within three weeks.
				</p>

				<h3 class="mt-4">3. Perfecting the Details</h3>
				<p>
					Our expert design associates can assist with space planning to optimize the toughest of layouts.
					After visiting our showroom, we offer in-home design consultations (to those not already working
					with a designer) to better identify the best products and finishes in your space. For designers, we
					offer CAD blocks and a sketch-up library that can jump-start and streamline your design process.
					Once your furniture is selected, we can provide dimensioned floor plans and 3D renderings so you can
					envision exactly how your space will be transformed. With final details like finishes and colors
					decided, we’ll provide a quote and estimated lead time, so you’ll know exactly what to expect.
				</p>

				<h3 class="mt-4">4. An Elevated Lifestyle</h3>
				<p>
					Once your design project is complete, you’ll step into a home that exceeds expectations in quality,
					style, and functionality. All of our wall beds come with a Lifetime Warranty, and Resource also
					offers reinstallation services so your furniture can move with you wherever you go.
